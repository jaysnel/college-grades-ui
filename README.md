# Student Grades and Courses

This is an app that allows you to add and keep track of current students that live on the blockchain.

Contract for this app lives at: https://github.com/jaysnel/college-grades

There is a `Directory` that lists all of the students and allows you to search by Name, Age, or Wallet. By clicking on a student, you are able to see their courses, credits, grades, and GPA.

There is a Add Student Directory that allows you to add a new student. You must have a valid wallet in order for a new student to be added.
